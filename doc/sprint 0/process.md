## Team Roles and Responsibilites 
- Scrum Masters: Kevin (our TA) and Sakina
- Product Owners: Flora and Lora
- Product Managers: Dineshan and Kemar
- Business Analyst: Jaya
- Visual Design: Saad and Seemin
- Coding/Testing: Everyone on the dev team
- Meeting Minutes: Each person on the dev team will be required to takes notes during at least one meeting

Some roles were not needed for phase 0, but we anticipate that we will need these roles for our future sprints. 

## Tools 
- Slack: two workspaces 
  * *CSCC01* for communication within dev team
  * *CSCC01Planit* for communication with product owners
- Google Hangouts for online meetings
- Jira for product backlog and sprint management (and in the future, communication)
- Github 

## Meetings 
We attempted to hold in-person and online meetings at least once a week. All team members were in attendance and participated equally. 

### September 17 (4 - 5 pm)
- In-person meeting
- Discussed sprint 0 and assigned tasks 
- Brainstormed a list of questions to ask the product owners
### September 19 (11 am - 12 pm)
- In-person meeting held during tutorial 
- Gathered client requirements
### September 21 (6 - 7 pm)
- Online meeting via Google Hangouts
- Brainstormed user stories (general and user-specific)
### Oct 1 (4 - 6:30 pm)
- In-person meeting
- Discussed user stories and user experience
### Oct 6 (5 - 8:30 pm)
- Online meeting via Google Hangouts
- Revised user stories, brainstormed scenarios using CRC cards, and completed planning poker

## Decision-Making
The product owners asked us to design and develop certain features for the application. We individually came up with different layouts, which were discussed as a team; we gave reasons why one would be preferable to another, and then put the decision to a vote. This way, everyone got to say, and in the end, the design choice rested on the general consensus of the team. We also ran our ideas with the product owners, which helped us to prioritize tasks and finalize plans.


## User Stories
In brainstorming user stories and setting the criteria of satisfaction, we used the INVEST acronym. We rewrote several user stories to meet the criteria. 

We usually had 2 rounds of voting to reach a consensus for the point estimate for each user story. This was because we timed ourselves so that it would not take longer than 2 minutes to set a point estimate. Consequently, we just had  enough time for the first round of voting, a discussion on discrepancies, and a second round of voting. In some cases where we could not reach a consensus within the 2-minute time frame, we flipped a coin to decide on the point estimate (if we were stuck choosing between 2 point estimates) or went with the most commonly-said point estimate (an absolute agreement was not necessary). 

To avoid being biased by others' responses, we shouted out what we believed to be the appropriate point estimate for a user story at the same time, and discussed the rationale behind our responses. 

The product owners determined the priority levels of our user stories. 

## Lessons & Plans for Sprint 1
### Lessons
- Take meeting minutes (which include date, time, location, purpose, attendees, decisions made, and actions required) so that we can keep track of the project. At times, we had repeated discussions on some issues. 
- Use fewer platforms for discussions and do not create too many Slack channels. Otherwise, notes will be scattered and therefore hard to find. 
- Plan ahead so we do not leave tasks to the last minute.
- Communicate with each other frequently (suggested response time: within 3 hours). During sprint 0, we were delayed on working on tasks because we needed to hear back from others before starting/completing the tasks. 
- Speak to product owners on a regular basis to clarify requirements and set priorities for the team. 

### Plans for Sprint 1
- Take meeting minutes for the sprint 1 planning meeting on Oct 10, 2019.   
- Hold daily scrum meetings with Sakina facilitating.
- For user stories included in sprint 1, assign each user story to a developer. All developers are responsible for breaking down their assigned user stories into tasks and completing them.
