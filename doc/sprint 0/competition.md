planit is different because an itinerary is created based on your chosen filters (and the itinerary can be synced to your device's calendar). In addition, at the end of your trip, you can rate each completed activity; ratings will help personalize your next itinerary. For example, if you rate a shopping mall 5 stars, it will likely be suggested in the next generated itinerary, provided that the shopping mall filter is chosen again.

planit is better suited for users who are unable to plan an itinerary on their own. It is likely that the competitors did not focus on these users because creating a usable itinerary is difficultâ€” we must factor in details, such as cost per person, travel time, typical time spent, and users' interests.

To implement the itinerary feature successfully, our competitors should allow users to change events within the generated itinerary. Also, our competitors should factor in and display details about each event on the itinerary (e.g. cost per person, travel time, and typical time spent).
