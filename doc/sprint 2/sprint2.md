# Sprint 2
## Meeting Notes:
All members of the group have participated equally in the meeting and have been listed below:

**Developers:**
* Kemar Harris
* Sakina Gadriwala
* Saad Shah
* Jaya Thirugnanasampanthan
* Seemin Syed
* Dineshan Pathmanathan

**Scrum Master:**
- Kevin Zhang

**Product Owners:**
- Flora Ng (not present during meeting)
- Lora Hasku (not present during meeting)

**Sprint Goals:**
- frontend: have a working user interface to be able to input forms
  - familiarizing with Flutter
- backend: move validation to a working server and also deal with data storage (i.e. some sort of database structure)
  - database of choice will be postgresql
  - working with Tianze to set up a server for project use
  - use database constraints in conjunction with code to improve validation

In our October 24th sprint meeting, Kevin tested our form entry and validation and reported no errors/issues (based on our CoS). Kevin suggested that we consider working on the frontend and backend much more in this sprint. In addition, Kevin recommended that we start integrating components together as early as possible since this is tricky.

As previously stated in the done.md file from sprint 0, a user story will be considered complete when the following criteria is met:
- [x] user story passes the criteria of satisfaction
- [x] all sub-tasks have been completed
- [x] code changes have been reviewed and tested by another team member

Developers will be working on branches for their respective user stories, then the code is merged to the master branch once the user story is considered to be complete. A developer is responsible for completing all the tasks for the user story they have been assigned.
