Notes:
Kemar:
What did I do yesterday?
Tried to find a suitable DB for project but failed (PLANN-60)
What will I do today?
Try to get Tianze to setup DB
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
I had to ask Kevin and Professor Dema for suggestions on DB. 
Professor Dema suggested that we get in touch with Tianze Sun to setup a PostgreSQL database for us so that we can use it in our project.
Once Tianze does this, I will be able to create the tables. 

Sakina:
What did I do yesterday?
Researched the Flutter widgets and how to set up the project on Android Studio (PLANN-79, PLANN-81).
What will I do today?
Set up frontend project on Github. 
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
I still don't know how to set up the Flutter project on Android Studio, and so I can't teach Jaya and Seemin.
