Notes:
Kemar:
What did I do yesterday?
Research into what DB is best to use for our project (PLANN-60)
What will I do today?
Continue researching into DB to use for app.
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Don't know how to let users download the app on their devices and access DB.
Therefore, I can't finalize the DB and create tables.

Sakina:
What did I do yesterday?
Research into Flutter widgets to use for attractions & number of participants GUI (PLANN-79, PLANN-81)
What will I do today?
Continue researching the Flutter widgets and how to set up the project on Android Studio so that I can teach Jaya and Seemin.
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Can't implement right away since we don't know how the validation should work. 
Can we use the widgets to block certain inputs (as part of validation)?

Saad:
What did I do yesterday?
Review REST for the API work (PLANN-63, PLANN-64, PLANN-67)
What will I do today?
N/A
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Kemar is struggling with DB work, so I can't write the code to hook up to the DB.

Jaya:
What did I do yesterday?
Research into Flutter widgets for transportation and distance GUI (PLANN-80, PLANN-81)
What will I do today?
I know the widgets I want to use for the GUI. Will look into how to implement them.
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
No one knows Flutter, so I will struggle with learning it. This means that it will take me a while before I can commit my work. 

Seemin:
What did I do yesterday?
Research into Flutter widgets for location, budget, and date-time GUI (PLANN-PLANN-77, PLANN-PLANN-78)
What will I do today?
Finalize the widgets for location, budget, and date-time GUI (PLANN-PLANN-77, PLANN-PLANN-78).
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Learning Flutter is a pain. Sakina has shared resources to learn Flutter. Also, I'm having issues with Android Studio and installing Flutter.

Dineshan:
What did I do yesterday?
Review REST for the API work (PLANN-69)
What will I do today?
N/A
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Kemar hasn't set up the DB, so I need to wait before coding.
