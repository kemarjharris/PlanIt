Notes:
Kemar:
What did I do yesterday?
Save an itinerary and get it to display on the main page.
What will I do today?
Change the main page to show a prompt to create a new itinerary
if the user doesn't have any. I also plan to make a button for
creating a new itinerary. This requies redoing the main file for
the front end page.
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Nothing. This page is pretty basic so it isn't hard to create.


Sakina:
What did I do yesterday?
Inspecting back end code for further testing and bug fixes.
What did I do today?
Begin working on the assigned APIs responsible for certain user stories (PLANN-106, PLANN-98).
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
It will take some time to adjust to backend code structure.

Saad:
What did I do yesterday?
Began work on the change event feature
What will I do today?
Continue with working on th change event feature
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Still not experienced with Flutter so progress is slow


Jaya:
What did I do yesterday?
Wrote documentation for others who will work on FE this sprint (PLANN-92).
What will I do today?
Continue writing documentation for others who will work on FE this sprint (PLANN-92).
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
I'm still struggling to understand Flutter, so I will need to review documentation and get help from others to accurately write documentation.

Dineshan:
What did I do yesterday? 
Start working on front-end designated tasks.
What did I do today?
Progress further with the completion of the front end for event details.
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Shaky understanding of Flutter's objects.

Seemin:
What did I do yesterday?
Decide if we should store events in the database or pull directly from API, and the relative pros and cons of each.
What will I do today?
Create a list of events from the foursquare API for the itinerary.
What problems are preventing me from making progress?
Lack of available parameters in public APIs to do exactly what we want.
