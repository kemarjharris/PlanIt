In our October 10th sprint meeting, we re-evaluated the user stories in the backlog in terms of story points and criteria of satisfaction. For the purposes of Sprint 1, the user stories have been broken down into tasks and will be evaluated through the back-end implementations only. In addition to this, databases will not be implemented, and testing will occur with the use of in memory implementations. We have prioritized proper functionality for the assigned tasks over including databases and UI. The console is used for testing purposes as an alternative, and the number of story points to be completed for this sprint is 17. When it came to choosing the user stories for this sprint, stories with the higest priority levels (and require lower effort to complete) were selected. However, due to time constraints, we will not work on all user stories with the highest priority levels (and requiring lower effort to accomplish); product owners chose the user stories to be worked on for this sprint.

As previously stated in the done.md file from sprint 0, a user story will be considered complete when the following criteria is met:
- [x] user story passes the criteria of satisfaction
- [x] all sub-tasks have been completed
- [x] code changes have been reviewed and tested by another team member

Developers will be working on branches for their respective user stories, then the code is merged to the master branch once the user story is considered to be complete. A developer is responsible for completing all the tasks for the user story they have been assigned.
