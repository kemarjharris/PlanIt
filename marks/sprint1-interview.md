|pivotal tracker|2|2|

**additional comments**:

- form entry and validation; both seem to work as intended
- most of the work done this sprint is very primitive
  - aim to consider working on the frontend and backend much more in this sprint
    - **frontend**: aim to have a working user interface to be able to input forms and send it to the backend server
    - **backend**: aim to move your validation to a working server and also deal with data storage (i.e. some sort of database structure)
  - do your best to not fall behind on integrating components
    - working on things in isolation is fine to start off but integrating components together is more tricky than you may think
