## planning meetings

**total mark**: 4/5

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|RPM.md is well documented|2|3|
|sprint1.md is well documented|2|2|

**additional comments**:

- `RPM.md` is missing references to user stories
    - was looking for what user stories you were planning on finishing each sprint
    - general goals were okay but was looking for more specificity
